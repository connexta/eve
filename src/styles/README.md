# Styling

For styling in this project, we used the library Styled Components.  The files in this folder contain styled components used for the different variants of the wallboard.

- **Styles.js**: Styled components that are consistent across the wallboard.  For instance, the cards on which components are placed and the headings of each component.
- **WallboardStyles.js**: Styled components for the different wallboard variants.  These components are used to prescribe the differences in how components are displayed across the different wallboards.
- **Calendar.css**: Stylings for the React Big Calendar used in Calendar.js.
