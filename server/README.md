### Data Storage

Data that needs to be stored on the back end, such as media to be displayed or version numbers, should be stored in the root-level `eve` folder.  A filepath has been established to make changes to this directory persistent between docker reploys, so data won't be erased when updates are deployed on the wallboard.
